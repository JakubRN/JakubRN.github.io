		<h1>Visualization Introductory Text</h1>
		<p>
			A brief outline over the fundamentals of our idea and visualization are given below in order to provide an introduction.
			A thorough analysis of the project can be found in our Explainer Page.

		<h2>What do you see?</h2>
		<p>
			The visualization starts with a projection map of NYC where two sets of clickable circles are added to pinpoint centers of
			areas with high pickup and dropoff activity. Color coding is applied on the map so that each hue is consistent to the
			number of people per square kilometer in the respective borough. As you can notice, the density of transportation activity
			becomes massive close to Manhattan, with four pickup centers surrounding it and one located in it. Therefore don’t be
			surprised to learn that Manhattan has twice the population per square kilometer than Queens and Brooklyn where the population
			in absolute number is higher than Manhattan.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two sets of buttons included to enable double filtering the results by narrowing down the datapoints of interest to only
			one quarter of the year, or between two different time intervals, one for day and another for night hours. Finally there
			are two timelines where you can see the trip count timeline filtered by your selection; if no selection is active then
			the timelines reflect all 2015 data. It is worth noting that the upper timeline shows the total count, while the lower
			can be filtered to display only day-hour or night-hour trips.
		</p>
		<h2>How it works?</h2>
		<p>
			Initially, before any selection is carried out by means of clicking some button the visualization reflects results over both
			day-time and night-time trips throughout 2015. You are able to activate either one button or two buttons (one in each
			set) simultaneously. The cluster centers and timelines will be updated according to your selection.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore when clicking on a cluster center on the map, e.g. a pickup center, red lines will connect it to all dropoff
			centers; in this case the width of each line reflects what portion of pickups from the clicked center led to dropoffs
			in the other cluster.
			<br/>Note that if you have two buttons activated simultaneously, then you’ll see the actual datapoints projected on the map
			in addition to the lines.
		</p>
		<h2>What is its purpose?</h2>
		<p>
			Observe the density and flow of transportations in NYC, locate the centers of massive transportation activity and quantify
			the proportion by which these centers communicate with one another. View the variations in pickup and dropoff densities
			between different seasons or during day or night hours. See the weekly oscillations on trip count and how they are distorted
			at certain periods.
