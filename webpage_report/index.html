					<h3>1.1 &nbsp Description of data</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="myPoint">

					<p>The dataset whose certain aspects we analyze in this project is
						<i>
							<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boro_taxi">
								<i>Green Taxi</i>
							</a> Trip Data</i> from New York City for the year 2015; this data is made available at
						<a target="_blank" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2015-Green-Taxi-Trip-Data/gi8d-wdg5">NYC Open Data</a>. The size of the original dataset is 2.12 GB and consists of 19.2 million observations (rows) of
						21 features (columns). At this very first stage we already tried to gather those features that can narrate an interesting
						story. Those features, presented on Table 1.1, include the exact datetime of each pickup and dropoff point, rate code,
						number of passengers, distance covered, total amount charged, payment and trip type for each trip; a more comprehensive
						description of these variables can be found
						<a target="_blank" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/gi8d-wdg5/files/77ea6e98-7096-453d-87f7-bfd5313b60d2?download=true&filename=data_dictionary_trip_records_green.pdf">here</a>. Moreover geographical projection data, in json format, is available for each pickup and dropoff location
						in the dataset. </p>
					<p>It is worth noting that this was our initial harvest of variables, where we reduced their number from 21 to 12; the
						8 contained in Table 1.1 plus 4 which are the longitude and latitude for each pickup and dropoff point. Later on, as
						we performed our analysis we realised that the extent of this project does not enable the inclusion of all those variables.</p>

					<h3>1.2 &nbsp Why this dataset</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="myPoint">
					<p>Our reason for selecting the dataset described in the previous section was not strictly related to green taxi activity
						in New York City. The early idea was to investigate transportations in NYC. The understanding of ransportation routine
						within a city is fairly intriguing and can reveal many important or underlying habits of its citizens' social life.
						Chasing the flow of people inside some city borders is likely to reveal all the vital routes and the most vivid locations.
					</p>
					<p>There are however few more practical reasons behind our choice of this specific dataset for carrying out our initial
						idea. One could find too many datasets related to transportations in NYC, e.g. Uber, Yellow Taxi, etc; therefore why
						Green Taxi data? First of all, since our purpose is general any of these datasets could have been used to implement
						this project and it is expected that results would be highly similar if not identical. The chief factor that led us
						to this dataset is that the number of observations (19.2 million) is feasible for our available computer power to work
						with; relevant Yellow Taxi or Uber data contained hundreds of millions of datapoints (ten's of GBs), thus hindering
						our efficiency dramatically. Moreover an early view of the dataset indicated that it was quite "healthy", consisting
						lots of interesting parameters, acceptable amount of missing values, and including geographical projection data for
						each pickup and dropoff location.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subHeader">
					<h3>1.3 &nbsp Goal of this project</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="myPoint">
					<p>The overall goal of this project is to produce an interactive visualization that can provide an adequate summary of
						annual transportations in NYC. Our effort is only on data for 2015, however it seems reasonable to assume that our
						results can be generalized for any relatively close, past or future, year. Furthermore we believe that an interesting
						point for the end user could be to observe the variations in pickup and dropoff densities between different seasons
						or during day or night, since the patterns are likely to be highly similar for consecutive days.
					</p>
					<p>We want the user to be able to observe the density and flow of transportations in NYC, to help him locate the centres
						of massive transportation activity and quantify the proportion by which these centres communicate with one another.
						Furthermore the visualization will be updated on user demand to illustrate results of our analysis for some specific
						quarter of the year or exclusively for day or night hours, hence offering the potential to witness the activity in
						different seasons or through day or night hours. Finally we also aim to provide an entertaining and eye-friendly result
						so that its use will be pleasant to the user.

				<h2>2. &nbsp Inital Exploratory Analysis</h2>
			</div>
			<p></p>
			<div class="myText">
				<div class="subHeader">
					<h3>2.1 &nbsp Data refining and preprocessing</h3>
					<p>As a very first task we had to import the data into the R development studio in order to process it. It proved to be
						rather challenging to import 2.12 GB in a data frame, and therefore we loaded it partially using multiple data frames
						of one million rows each. It soon became clear that almost five million rows of the initial dataset were corrupted,
						thus reducing the number of observations to 14 million. As one would expect the spoiled rows were not uniform, resulting
						in a disturbing asymmetry where January and February datapoints were disproportionately more than those of other months.
						This issue hindered us from deriving aggregate statistics over the full dataset, however we proceeded with sampling
						100.000 observations from each month, hence forming a new dataset of 1,2 million rows. </p>
					<p>A dataset of 1,2 million datapoints seems rather feasible for our computer power to handle, nevertheless one more limitation
						was imposed from D3 where at some point we wished to visualize the actual pickup and dropoff points on the projection
						map of NYC. Displaying more than 30-35 thousand points at the same time would cause a gradually increasing time delay
						when interactivity is enabled. Moreover 1,2 million pickup and dropoff locations imply 2,4 million projection points,
						which is impossible for D3 to cope with. Therefore we had to come up with a plan to narrow down the number of points
						to be projected through filtering, while also retaining the desirable information for the user. </p>
					<p>Our plan was to consider only two time intervals within each day rather than the whole 24 hours, namely 6am to 12pm
						and 10pm to 4am to represent Day and Night hours, respectively. The latter step, together with the exclusion of few
						extremely outlying pickup or dropoff locations, dropped the number of rows down to 589.531, and further provided the
						potential for a split, as illustrated in Figure 2.1, between observations that took place during day from those at
						night hours. The majority of observations, namely 310.326 were night trips, whereas the remaining 279.205 were day
						trips. Afterwards we implemented a second level split into the four quarters of a year (Q1: Jan-Feb-Mar, Q2: Apr-May-Jun,
						Q3: Jul-Aug-Sep and Q4: Oct-Nov-Dec), depicted in Figure 2.2. This final attempt further narrowed the number of observations
						at each leaf down to 70-80 thousand. </p>
					<p>The two-level-split led to a significant reduction of the number of observations at the leaves, however one more step
						was required in order to get an amount of datapoints that are feasible to project on the NYC map without lagging on
						user updates. At this point the idea was to use the k-means clustering algorithm to find some centres in pickup and
						dropoff points and classify each of them to the cluster characterized by its closest centre. Details for the k-means
						fit are given in the following subsection; it is worth noting that our objective was finally met, hence after selecting
						quarter, time interval and cluster centre the end user will be able to see the actual pickup and dropoff points projected
						on the NYC map.</p>

					<h3>2.2 &nbsp Statistics of interest</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="myPoint">
					<p>The statistics that we employed to carry out our goal for this project were the
						<b>
							<i>daily count of trips</i>
						</b> and the estimated, from the k-means algorithm,
						<b>
							<i>pickup</i>
						</b> and
						<b>
							<i>dropoff clusters</i>
						</b>. We counted the trips for each day, considering only the two time intervals (12 hours per day in total) as described
						in the previous subsection. Furthermore the amount of trips during explicitly day or night hours was calculated and
						is provided in the visualization, where in addition when the user selects a specific quarter of the year the trip count
						timelines zoom on that quarter alone. </p>
					<p>Early plots of trip count timelines from our exploratory analysis are illustrated in Figures 2.3 and 2.4, where one
						can easily observe the weekly patterns with peaks close to weekends and further two singular spurs at new years eve
						day and at 27th of January, with a profound peak in the former, while for the latter an extreme minimum of trip counts.
					</p>
					<p>Figure 2.3 contains the aggregate number of trips for both day and night hours, hence we would like to disambiguate
						this statistics during day (6am-12pm) and night (10pm-4am) hours. For this reason we present Figure 2.4 where the two
						time intervals were unbundled and trip counts for each of them is depicted throughout 2015. It can be seen that the
						amount of trips at night hours vary dramatically within weeks compared to that in day hours, and moreover that the
						impact of new years eve day affects only night trips, while in the 27th of January day trips seem to have a more severe
						effect on the count.
					</p>
					<p>It is worth noting that the timelines presented in this subsection are made upon sampling only 1,2 million out of 19,2
						million datapoints and further by analyzing the two time intervals (narrowing down to 589.531 observations) that represent
						day and night hours as explained above. However the results capture the dynamics of the original full dataset sufficiently,
						as can be verified
						<a target="_blank" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2015-Green-Taxi-Trip-Data/n4kn-dy2y">here</a>.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p>The second stage of our analysis included applying k-means algorithm to both pickup and dropoff locations for each node
						of the tree in Figure 2.2, as well as for all day and all night trips separately. More specifically the algorithm was
						used to estimate pickup and dropoff centres for each of these 15 datasets, therefore 30 sets of clusters were derived
						in total. Our reason for doing so is that we observed cluster centres to vary between at some quarters and in total
						between day and night trips. Figure 2.5 for example illustrates pickup cluster centres for all day and night trips,
						where it can be seen that they are almost identical, while in Figure 2.6 the relevant dropoff cluster centres appear
						to differ quite alot. Moreover one can witness that there are differences between pickup and dropoff cluster centres
						in general. </p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p>We aimed from the beginning to find a way to narrow down the number of datapoints so that geographical projection on
						NYC map would be possible, and the user would be able to view the exact pickup and dropoff locations as well as how
						these actual points are clustered. Results of k-means for day trips at the fourth quarter of 2015 are demonstrated
						on Figures 2.7 and 2.8 for pickups and dropoffs, respectively. One can observe some differences in the pickup and dropoff
						densities, and moreover how the clusters look at each case. This method gave us the means to create clusters of appropriate
						sizes so that we could store and project the actual pickup with corresponding dropoff locations for one cluster at
						a time and vice versa, on the NYC map without lag. Therefore both the centres of areas with dense activity as well
						as the flow between them will be present on our visualization. </p>

				<div class="myPoint">
					<p>Our visualization's genre is the
						<b>Annotated Graph/Map</b>, namely a map of NYC is employed so that the user would be able to view the centres of transportation
						activity projected on the map, together with the actual pickup and dropoff locations if he completes a full selection
						of quarter, day/night hours and cluster centre. Moreover two timelines are included to illustrate the total and day/night
						count of trips, respectively, throughout some time interval which he/she will determine. We believe that this genre

					<h3>3.2 &nbsp Choise of Visual Narrative</h3>

					<p>We used a

						while finally the width of the red flow lines is also the fraction of between cluster trips.
						<b>Feature distinction</b>
						is also being employed to indicate pickup (blue) and dropoff (orange) cluster centres or actual projected locations, as well

					<p>A

						relative population per square kilometer, namely the more intense the hue the higher the population density.
					</p>
					<p>Pickup and Dropoff cluster centres are represented by the blue and orange
						<b>circles</b>, respectively. The

						<b>Clicking on</b> a pickup/dropoff centre will reveal the flow of trips between this pickup/dropoff and all dropoff/pickup
						clusters by connecting them with
						<b>red lines</b> each having
						<b>width</b> proportional to the count of trips between the relevant clusters.
					</p>
					<p>At the bottom of the page there are
						<b>two timelines</b>; the upper shows the count of trips from the full sample, while the lower demonstrates the count
						of daily and/or nightly trips over some prespecified time interval, as explained below.
					</p>
					<p>Initially the view corresponds to our full sample, namely daily and nightly trips throughout 2015. The user is able
						to filter the data by quarter of the year, time span or cross-filter on both through
						<b>clicking on</b> the relevant
						<b>buttons</b>. The selection will filter the data accordingly, adjusting the timelines and projection map to currently
						active filters.
						<br/>Note that if both a quarter and time span are selected then upon clicking on some centre the actual pickup and dropoff
						points will be projected on the map together with the red flow lines.</p>

					<h3>4.2 &nbsp Appropriateness of storytelling</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="myPoint">
					<p>Our idea, as expressed in subsection 1.3, was to generate a visualization that is able to illustrate the density of
						transportations in NYC throughout a year, the most vivid areas as well as the flow between these areas. In addition
						we would like to provide further insight over the annual dynamics of transportation activity.
					</p>
					<p>Our final product, as described in the previous subsection, offers an initial view of the density of transportation
						in NYC over 2015 which is fairly intuitive and easy to manipulate in order to gain further insight over how areas of
						dense activity vary between quarters and especially between day and night hours, while further clicking on some centre
						displays the transportational flow related to it.
					</p>
					<p>Finally the two timelines picture the dynamics of transportation activity over the prespecified time span.</p>

			</div>
			<p></p>
			<div class="myText">
				<div class="subHeader">
					<h3>5.1 &nbsp Implementation</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="myPoint">
					<p>Firstly we downloaded 2015 Green Taxi Trip data and imported the full dataset, of 19.2 million rows, in R Studio, where
						we could figure out that almost 5 million rows were corrupted, and hence we dropped them. Afterwards we used this dataset
						to aggregate the number of trips per day and by plotting the result it was obvious that the timeline was distorted.
						The reason was that the corrupted lines were not evenly distributed between months, thus we had assymetrically more
						observations for January and February than for other months. </p>
					<p>We addressed this problem by sampling 100.000 observations from each month, then aggregating per day and plotting anew
						we joyfully witnessed that the dynamics of the full dataset was almost entirely preserved in our sample. Hence we proceeded
						to the analysis described in section 2 where unexpectedly when fitting k-means into pickup and dropoff locations the
						algorithm, based on information criteria, pointed the optimal number of clusters to be 6.
					</p>
					<p>Projecting the cluster centres onto the NYC map we could see that almost all of them were located close to Manhattan,
						which as anticipated appeared to be the heart of transportation activity in NYC. We sought to attribute this outcome
						to the population of Boroughs, however we found out that Brooklyn and Queens have larger population than Manhattan
						which was somehow odd, and hence we turned our attention towards population density or population per square kilometer
						and figured out that Manhattan has two times the amount of people per square kilometer than Brooklyn or Queens. Eventually
						we decided to reflect this information as color code on our projection map.
					</p>
					<p>At this point we would like to remind you that different k-means algorithms were fitted in each pickup and dropoff dataset,
						with the corollary of no correspondence between pickup and dropoff cluster ids. More specifically we knew the pickup
						and dropoff cluster of each observation but we didn't know which cluster centre corresponded to an id, hence having
						a problem in illustrating the flow (width of red lines) correctly. However this issue was solved under an assumption
						that was verified empirically, namely that the highest activity takes place between nearest clusters. In other words
						we assumed that a pickup cluster matches its nearest dropoff cluster, which ensued valid segmentation of flow.
					</p>
					<p>It is our conviction that the goal of this project is achieved successfully, all our objectives have been met and are
						present on the visualization.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subHeader">
					<h3>5.2 &nbsp Implications</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="myPoint">
					<p>Our early plan was to include interactive tooltips on the timelines, so that hovering on a point would display the exact
						date and trip count. However later in our analysis we decided to focus the visualization around the map, where the
						density and flow of trips was illustrated and have the timelines as an additional feature to highlight further insight
						on the dynamics of transportation activity. Moreover the count itself has nothing to contribute on our project goal,
						hence the effort was abandoned.</p>

				<h2>6. &nbsp Contributions</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="myText">
				<div class="myPoint">
					<p>Jakub Niedzwiedzki, as a student in the department of Computer Science is more experienced in software development,
						thus took the lead in implementing the visualization webpage. Structuring the javascript/D3 source code, as well asintroducing
						features and expertise that made our work more efficient and productive such as using python with pandas, glob and
						nested dictionaries to preprocess whole directories of csv files into one JSON object etc. Furthermore being already
						set up and familiar with github, he enabled the group to directly meet the hand-in requirements. </p>
					<p>Georgios Vassos as a student in the department of Mathematical Modelling and Computation has broader experience in manipulating
						large datasets, preprocessing and statistical analysis, hence leaded the data analysis part of the project. The process
						of generating functional datasets that could enable the development of a nice and meaningful visualization through
						clean source code, as well as knowledge on courses of action and a large toolbox for data analysis contributed in the
						efficiency of the group.</p>
					<p>Collaboration between the group members was excellent, all ideas were developed and discussed in common and every action
						took place under consensus, moreover complementary skills increased the group's efficiency. The working hours were
						split evenly and both members contributed in all aspects of the project equally. We believe that the leading role of
						each member is justified by the course objectives.
